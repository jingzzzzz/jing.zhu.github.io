Jing Zhu currently is a research scientist at Samsung Research America AI Center, working on 3D computer vision projects. She received her PhD from New York University and advised by [Prof. Yi Fang](http://mmvc.engineering.nyu.edu). Her PhD dissertation title "(3D) Geometric Feature Learning from 2D Images" obtained **2020 NYU Pearl Brownstein Doctoral Research Award** (awarded to PhD students whose doctoral research shows the greatest promise). She also did her master at New York University, where she worked with [Prof. Edward Wong](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/edward-wong).
